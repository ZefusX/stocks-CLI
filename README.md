# Get the price of a stock from your terminal

Uses GO and Alphavantage API to get the stock price. 
<br>
**⚠️ If you don't want to get limited by the API change the API Key in the program and rebuild the EXE, the rate is 25 requests / day**
<br>
<br>
However if you're just curious and don't really care about stocks, you can use my API Key since I don't care about getting stocks price

## How does it works 

Download the folder, navigate to it, open your terminal and type
```stocks *STOCKS*```
*STOCKS* being the symbol like AAPL, GOOGL etc...

## Exemple : 

```stocks GOOGL```
Returns
```
-----GOOGL-----
